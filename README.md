# Raspberry-Pi-Project
This is the working prototype of one of Carolina Tech Explorers' projects for the 2018-2019 school year. Using PubNub API and Spotify API, CTE created a web application that communicates between Spotify and a Raspberry Pi, allowing users to play and pause a song or playlist at the press of a button on the Pi.

### Future Developments
Currently, the playlist can be replaced by changing the context URI in the code. In the upcoming year, we'd like to create a user-friendly way to replace the playlist. We'd also like to automatize the retrieval of tokens for Spotify API, as well as 3D print a more accessible button.
